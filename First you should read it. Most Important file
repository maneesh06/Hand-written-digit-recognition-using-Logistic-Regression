There is data set in ex3data1.mat that contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits.  
There are 5000 training examples in ex3data1.mat, where each training example is a 20 pixel
by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number 
indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is 'unrolled' 
into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix X. 
This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix X where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.
